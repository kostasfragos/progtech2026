# progtech2026
## In this repo I will be uploading every single exercise of the course "progtech" of the season 2025-2026 in NTUA.

- In the [useful_programs](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progintro2025/tree/main/useful_programs) folder you can find some common algorithm implementations that might help you throughout the course.

- In the first set [(1η Σειρά)](https://github.com/kostasfragos/progtech2026/tree/main/1%CE%B7%20%CE%A3%CE%B5%CE%B9%CF%81%CE%AC), in order to run the files properly you need to compile just the "...test.cpp" files using the command " g++ fullratiotest.cpp fullratio.cpp -o fullratio.exe " (in VS Code).
